Machine Learning with Iris Dataset 

Iris Dataset is the "Hello World" of machine learning. This is the best known classification problem for beginners. The aim is to classify iris flowers among three species (setosa, versicolor or virginica) from measurements of length and width of sepals and petals.

This dataset contains 150 rows and 5 columns. Four columns gives the measurements of different species of iris which are sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width and the fifth column contains three different species of iris. 

Step by step approach to machine learning problem 

1. Importing Libraries
2. Loading the Dataset
3. Inspecting the data
4. Data Visualization 
5. Algorithm Evalution (Seven different algorithms have been used and compared to find the best model)
6. Prediction
